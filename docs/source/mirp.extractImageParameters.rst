Extract image metadata
======================

Image metadata, such as acquisition and reconstruction parameters, are interesting to report. To facilitate their
reporting, MIRP can automatically extract relevant parameters from metadata.

.. note::
    Many relevant parameters can only extracted from DICOM files, because other file types lack the
    corresponding metadata.
