Installing MIRP
===============
MIRP is available from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mirp/>`_ and can be installed using ``pip``, or other installer
tools:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install mirp

.. note::
    We highly recommend installing MIRP in a virtual environment to avoid dependency issues. For more information
